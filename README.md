# SVG Logo Maker
A command-line app that will allow you to generate a simple logo for your projects.

# Description
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to generate a simple logo for their projects. It prompts the user to enter up to three characters for the logo's text, select a color (either a color keyword or a hexadecimal number), and choose a shape from a list of options (circle, triangle, or square). The application then generates an SVG file representing the logo and saves it as logo.svg.

The purpose of this application is to provide a simple and cost-effective solution for freelance web developers who need a logo for their projects but don't want to hire a graphic designer. The generated SVG file can be easily used in websites or other digital media.
